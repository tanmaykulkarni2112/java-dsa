The arrays are the most common ways of storing the data in the contiguous memory form.

All the data within the Arrays will be of the same datatype. The array of the `int` type will only contain the integers.

The syntax for the arrays is :

```java
// syntax datatype[] variable_name = new datatype[size];

// storing of 5 numbers
int[] rollnumber = new int[5];

// or we can store the numbers directly like -
int[] rolls = {1,2,3,4,5};

```
